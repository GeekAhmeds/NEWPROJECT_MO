### Notes:
- `{id}` in the URLs should be replaced with the actual ID of the category or book you are trying to access.
- When creating or updating records, ensure that your request body contains the necessary data formatted as JSON, and the appropriate headers are set (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`).
- The actual path to these endpoints may vary depending on how you've set up your Django project's root URL configuration. The above paths assume that the app's `urls.py` is directly included in the project's `urls.py`.
